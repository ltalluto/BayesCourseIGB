# Introductory Bayesian statistics for ecologists

12 November, 9:30 until 19 November 2018, 17:30<br/>
IGB, MÃ¼ggelseedamm 310, lecture hall

## Course objectives

This course will cover the basics of Bayesian statistical methods with applications in ecology. Bayesian methods are a powerful set of tools that are increasingly used with complex ecological data. These methods can also be extended quite easily byond simple statistics to include process-based/mechanistic models. By the end of the course, participants should be able to:

* Understand basic concepts from probability theory
* Apply maximum likelihood and Bayes' Theorem to common statistical problems
* Express symbolically and in code the likelihood and prior probability of a Bayesian model
* Write a simple Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampler in R
* Write code for various models (including descriptive statistics, uni/multivariate linear regression, generalised linear models, and hierarchical models) in R or Stan
* Visualise and evaluate MCMC output

## Prerequisites

Participants will need to be comfortable programming in R and have a good understanding of basic statistics.

Students will work in small groups on a project building a Bayesian model from scratch. Any students that have data they wish to work on (and are willing to share with a group) are strongly encouraged to do bring their data to the class and to use them for the project. Students without data can find a project by working with a group or use data from freely available sources.

## General Schedule
Most days will consist of a mixture of lecture, individual coding practise, and work on group projects/presentations.
